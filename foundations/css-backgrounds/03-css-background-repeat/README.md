# Methods for Adding CSS
In this exercise, you're going to practice using the background repeat-property

By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

This looks strange so to avoid this the background-repeat property is used.

There are 3 types of background repeat property:
  1.repeat-x
  2.repeat-y
  3.no-repeat

The background repeat of a page is set like this:

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
  //or background-repeat: repeat-y;
  //or background-repeat: no repeat;
}
