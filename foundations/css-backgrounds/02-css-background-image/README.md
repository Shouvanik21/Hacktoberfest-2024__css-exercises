# Methods for Adding CSS
In this exercise, you're going to practice adding image using CSS to an HTML file.

The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image repeats itself so it covers the entire element.

The background image of a page is set like this:

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}
